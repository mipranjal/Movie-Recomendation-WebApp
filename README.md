# Movie Recommendation Web App
This is a web application that recommends movies based on user input. The app is built using Python and Streamlit, and uses a machine learning model to make movie recommendations.

## Getting Started
To use the app, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone
```
https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-web-app.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:


```
cd movie-recommendation-web-app
```

Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt```


Start the app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should now be running locally at http://localhost:8501.

## Usage
When you open the app in your web browser, you'll be presented with a form where you can select a movie genre and enter a movie title. Based on your input, the app will recommend a list of movies that are similar to the one you entered.

## Credits
The movie recommendation model is based on the TMDB dataset, which was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

The app was built using Streamlit, a Python framework for building data apps. You can learn more about Streamlit at https://www.streamlit.io/
